/// Base class for objects involved in the simulation.
///
/// @section simobject_intro Introduction
///
/// SimObject is a base class for most of the classes you'll encounter
/// working in Torque. It provides fundamental services allowing "smart"
/// object referencing, creation, destruction, organization, and location.
/// Along with SimEvent, it gives you a flexible event-scheduling system,
/// as well as laying the foundation for the in-game editors, GUI system,
/// and other vital subsystems.
///
/// @section simobject_subclassing Subclassing
///
/// You will spend a lot of your time in Torque subclassing, or working
/// with subclasses of, SimObject. SimObject is designed to be easy to
/// subclass.
///
/// You should not need to override anything in a subclass except:
///     - The constructor/destructor.
///     - processArguments()
///     - onAdd()/onRemove()
///     - onGroupAdd()/onGroupRemove()
///     - onNameChange()
///     - onStaticModified()
///     - onDeleteNotify()
///     - onEditorEnable()/onEditorDisable()
///     - inspectPreApply()/inspectPostApply()
///     - things from ConsoleObject (see ConsoleObject docs for specifics)
///
/// Of course, if you know what you're doing, go nuts! But in most cases, you
/// shouldn't need to touch things not on that list.
///
/// When you subclass, you should define a typedef in the class, called Parent,
/// that references the class you're inheriting from.
///
/// @code
/// class mySubClass : public SimObject {
///     typedef SimObject Parent;
///     ...
/// @endcode
///
/// Then, when you override a method, put in:
///
/// @code
/// bool mySubClass::onAdd()
/// {
///     if(!Parent::onAdd())
///         return false;
///
///     // ... do other things ...
/// }
/// @endcode
///
/// Of course, you want to replace onAdd with the appropriate method call.
///
/// @section simobject_lifecycle A SimObject's Life Cycle
///
/// SimObjects do not live apart. One of the primary benefits of using a
/// SimObject is that you can uniquely identify it and easily find it (using
/// its ID). Torque does this by keeping a global hierarchy of SimGroups -
/// a tree - containing every registered SimObject. You can then query
/// for a given object using Sim::findObject() (or SimSet::findObject() if
/// you want to search only a specific set).
///
/// @code
///        // Three examples of registering an object.
///
///        // Method 1:
///        AIClient *aiPlayer = new AIClient();
///        aiPlayer->registerObject();
///
///        // Method 2:
///        ActionMap* globalMap = new ActionMap;
///        globalMap->registerObject("GlobalActionMap");
///
///        // Method 3:
///        bool reg = mObj->registerObject(id);
/// @endcode
///
/// Registering a SimObject performs these tasks:
///     - Marks the object as not cleared and not removed.
///     - Assigns the object a unique SimObjectID if it does not have one already.
///     - Adds the object to the global name and ID dictionaries so it can be found
///       again.
///     - Calls the object's onAdd() method. <b>Note:</b> SimObject::onAdd() performs
///       some important initialization steps. See @ref simobject_subclassing "here
///       for details" on how to properly subclass SimObject.
///     - If onAdd() fails (returns false), it calls unregisterObject().
///     - Checks to make sure that the SimObject was properly initialized (and asserts
///       if not).
///
/// Calling registerObject() and passing an ID or a name will cause the object to be
/// assigned that name and/or ID before it is registered.
///
/// Congratulations, you have now registered your object! What now?
///
/// Well, hopefully, the SimObject will have a long, useful life. But eventually,
/// it must die.
///
/// There are a two ways a SimObject can die.
///         - First, the game can be shut down. This causes the root SimGroup
///           to be unregistered and deleted. When a SimGroup is unregistered,
///           it unregisters all of its member SimObjects; this results in everything
///           that has been registered with Sim being unregistered, as everything
///           registered with Sim is in the root group.
///         - Second, you can manually kill it off, either by calling unregisterObject()
///           or by calling deleteObject().
///
/// When you unregister a SimObject, the following tasks are performed:
///     - The object is flagged as removed.
///     - Notifications are cleaned up.
///     - If the object is in a group, then it removes itself from the group.
///     - Delete notifications are sent out.
///     - Finally, the object removes itself from the Sim globals, and tells
///       Sim to get rid of any pending events for it.
///
/// If you call deleteObject(), all of the above tasks are performed, in addition
/// to some sanity checking to make sure the object was previously added properly,
/// and isn't in the process of being deleted. After the object is unregistered, it
/// de-allocates itself.
///
/// @section simobject_editor Torque Editors
///
/// SimObjects are one of the building blocks for the in-game editors. They
/// provide a basic interface for the editor to be able to list the fields
/// of the object, update them safely and reliably, and inform the object
/// things have changed.
///
/// This interface is implemented in the following areas:
///     - onNameChange() is called when the object is renamed.
///     - onStaticModified() is called whenever a static field is modified.
///     - inspectPreApply() is called before the object's fields are updated,
///                     when changes are being applied.
///     - inspectPostApply() is called after the object's fields are updated.
///     - onEditorEnable() is called whenever an editor is enabled (for instance,
///                     when you hit F11 to bring up the world editor).
///     - onEditorDisable() is called whenever the editor is disabled (for instance,
///                     when you hit F11 again to close the world editor).
///
/// (Note: you can check the variable gEditingMission to see if the mission editor
/// is running; if so, you may want to render special indicators. For instance, the
/// fxFoliageReplicator renders inner and outer radii when the mission editor is
/// running.)
///
/// @section simobject_console The Console
///
/// SimObject extends ConsoleObject by allowing you to
/// to set arbitrary dynamic fields on the object, as well as
/// statically defined fields. This is done through two methods,
/// setDataField and getDataField, which deal with the complexities of
/// allowing access to two different types of object fields.
///
/// Static fields take priority over dynamic fields. This is to be
/// expected, as the role of dynamic fields is to allow data to be
/// stored in addition to the predefined fields.
///
/// The fields in a SimObject are like properties (or fields) in a class.
///
/// Some fields may be arrays, which is what the array parameter is for; if it's non-null,
/// then it is parsed with dAtoI and used as an index into the array. If you access something
/// as an array which isn't, then you get an empty string.
///
/// <b>You don't need to read any further than this.</b> Right now,
/// set/getDataField are called a total of 6 times through the entire
/// Torque codebase. Therefore, you probably don't need to be familiar
/// with the details of accessing them. You may want to look at Con::setData
/// instead. Most of the time you will probably be accessing fields directly,
/// or using the scripting language, which in either case means you don't
/// need to do anything special.
///
/// The functions to get/set these fields are very straightforward:
///
/// @code
///  setDataField(StringTable->insert("locked", false), NULL, b ? "true" : "false" );
///  curObject->setDataField(curField, curFieldArray, STR.getStringValue());
///  setDataField(slotName, array, value);
/// @endcode
///
/// <i>For advanced users:</i> There are two flags which control the behavior
/// of these functions. The first is ModStaticFields, which controls whether
/// or not the DataField functions look through the static fields (defined
/// with addField; see ConsoleObject for details) of the class. The second
/// is ModDynamicFields, which controls dynamically defined fields. They are
/// set automatically by the console constructor code.
