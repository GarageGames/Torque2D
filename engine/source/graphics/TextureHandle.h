/// This is the main texture manager interface.  Texturing can be
/// a bit complicated, but if you follow these easy steps, it is
/// really quite simple!
///
/// In order to use a texture on disk, first you must create a
/// TextureHandle data structure for it.
/// @code
/// TextureHandle handle = TextureHandle("pathToTexture", textureType);
/// @endcode
/// See the documentation on the different enumerated types for more info
/// on texture types.
///
/// Ok, now you have your texture loaded into video memory or ram,
/// whichever is chooses.  In order to tell OpenGL to use your texture,
/// you have to bind it.  GL_TEXTURE_2D is the type of texture you're
/// binding - a 2 dimisional texture.  Also note that you only have
/// to do this if you are using direct OpenGL commands to draw rather
/// than dgl.  Dgl manages the below on it's own so you don't have to worry about it.
/// @code
/// glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, handle.getGLName());
/// @endcode
/// Now you can begin to draw you texture.  If you havn't already,
/// make sure you make a call to glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_2D);  before
/// you start drawing and a call to glDisable(GL_TEXTURE_2D); when
/// you're done.  Failure to call glEnable will cause the texture not
/// to draw, and failure to call glDisable will probably case
/// an assert in debug mode and ugly artifacts in release.
///
/// If you are going through dgl, all you need is the TextureHandle and
/// some points.  See the dgl documentation for more info on each
/// individual function in the dgl library.  However, most dgl functions
/// will take a TextureObject data type.  And, it just so happens that
/// a TextureHandle has a TextureObject!  It also has an
/// operator TextureObject*(), which lets you cast a TextureHandle to
/// a TextureObject.  That means that all you have to do is ignore
/// the TextureObject parameter and just give it a TextureHandle.
///
/// Some tips on texture performance:
///
/// Instead of using hard-coded paths, use a hook to a console variable.
/// You will probably change the directory structure for your game,
/// and that means that you will have to go back to all of the hardcoded
/// paths and change them by hand, then rebuild the engine.  It is much
/// better to use script variables since they are all in one place and
/// easier to change.
///
/// Add the path string for your texture to the StringTable.  Doing so
/// helps in string lookups and faster string performance.
///
/// Don't create the texture every frame if at all possible.  Make it
/// a global variable if you have to - just don't load every frame.
/// Loading data off of the disk every frame WILL cause massive
/// performance loss and should be avoided at all costs.  This is
/// not to mention the overhead of generating mip map levels
/// and uploading the texture into memory when the texture is created.
///
/// @note
/// Texture handles can be allocated in 2 ways - by name to be loaded
/// from disk, or by name to a dynamically generated texture
///
/// If you create a GBitmap and register it, the Texture manager
/// owns the pointer - so if you re-register a texture with the same
/// name, the texture manager will delete the second copy.
///
/// Also note the operator TextureObject*, as you can actually cast
/// a TextureHandle to a TextureObject* if necessary.
