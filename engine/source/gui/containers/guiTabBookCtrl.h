///
/// @section GuiTabBookCtrl_Intro Introduction
///
/// GuiTabBookCtrl is a container class that holds children of type GuiTabPageCtrl
///
/// GuiTabBookCtrl creates an easy to work with system for creating tabbed dialogs
/// allowing for creation of dialogs that store alot of information in a small area
/// by seperating the information into pages which are changeable by clicking their
/// page title on top or bottom of the control
///
/// tabs may be aligned to be on top or bottom of the book and are changeable while
/// the GUI editor is open for quick switching between pages allowing multipage dialogs
/// to be edited quickly and easily.
///
/// The control may only contain children of type GuiTabPageCtrl.
/// If a control is added to the Book that is not of type GuiTabPageCtrl, it will be
/// removed and relocated to the currently active page of the control.
/// If there is no active page in the book, the child control will be relocated to the
/// parent of the book.
///
/// @ref GUI has an overview of the GUI system.
