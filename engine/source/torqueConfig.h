///
/// 'TORQUE_DEBUG'
/// Should be associated with a compiler un-optimized build.  Typically produces more

///
/// 'TORQUE_RELEASE'
/// Should be associated with a compiler optimized build.  Typically produces less
/// diagnostic engine output than the 'TORQUE_DEBUG' build.

/// 'TORQUE_SHIPPING'
/// Should be associated with a compiler optimized build that you intend to ship.

/// end-user to report.
///
/// 'TORQUE_UNICODE'
/// When defined, enables unicode support.
///
/// 'TORQUE_ENABLE_PROFILER'
/// When defined, Torque will capture performance profiling information that sacrifices
/// a small performance overhead to gain significant diagnostics information.
///
/// 'TORQUE_DEBUG_NET'
/// When defined, Torque will enabled certain features that enabled diagnostics of
/// its networking sub-system.
///
/// 'TORQUE_GATHER_METRICS'
/// When defined, Torque will gather additional performance metrics.
///
/// 'TORQUE_MULTITHREAD'
/// When defined, Torque will attempt to make select systems thread-safe.  This does not
/// make the entire engine thread-safe nor is it a magic bullet that will make the engine
/// perform operations in parallel and speed-up the engine.
